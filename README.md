# Single Page Lightweight Application Template (SPLAT)

SPLAT is a lightweight meta-framework for creating JS-based applications.  It's initial implementation is a wrapper around W2UI aiming to simplify usage and reduce boilerplate code.

The intention is for SPLAT to provide a generic API that can be utilized with other systems, such that W2UI can theoretically be supplemented with, or replaced by, other libraries with minimal impact to the driving application. 

To test this library, simply clone this repository and it's submodules (git clone --recursive) and load the example HTML pages through your preferred web server (JS may have issues loading modules if you access it directly from the local filesystem).


This library is a work in progress, with my current target being purely local development and applications.  It makes no attempt at backwards compatibility with older browsers.

Documentation is TODO, but the code+examples should be largely self-documenting.

If you find this library useful, please post to the 'Discussions' section, and report bugs in the tracker.  PRs are welcome.
